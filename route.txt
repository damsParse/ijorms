After making the requirements clear, we can be sure that the sections that the candidate uses in the resume can be exhaustive to some extent.
My guess is that we can look for a set of sections one by one. A possible approach would be:

1. Create a list of all possible sections
   eg: personal details|skills|training|work experience|education|qualification|references|... (I think this list can be made exhaustive)

2. Now create the first level structure using the above sections. 
   Search for above keys in the resume
   The part of text included between two of them belongs to the first one
   eg:

     education\n\n\nBSC lorem ipsum....\nMSC ... ... \n\nskills\n\nDatabases worked for xyz for 2 years... \nMachine learning... ... \n
    
    For this text, we look for the first occurence of one of the keys, 'education' in this case, and go for another one, i.e. 'skills', 
    so we can capture the part from 'education' before 'skills' under 'education'

    The problem is, can we make the list exhaustive?

3. Now that top level segmentation has been achieved, sub sections need to be captured.
   Methods usable:
   Regexes
   NER
   ...
   For this, I think we need to create the skill taxonomy (or ontology).
